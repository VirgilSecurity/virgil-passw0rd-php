## Introduction
<a href="https://passw0rd.io/"><img width="260px" src="https://cdn.virgilsecurity.com/assets/images/github/logos/passw0rd.png" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>[Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com) introduces an implementation of the [Password-Hardened Encryption (PHE) protocol](https://virgilsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/PHE-Whitepaper-2018.pdf) that provides developers with a technology to protect users passwords from offline/online attacks and make stolen passwords useless even if your database has been compromised.

PHE is a new, more secure mechanism that protects user passwords and lessens the security risks associated with weak passwords. Neither Virgil nor attackers know anything about user's password.

**Authors of the PHE protocol**: Russell W. F. Lai, Christoph Egger, Manuel Reinert, Sherman S. M. Chow, Matteo Maffei and Dominique Schroder.

## Features
- Zero knowledge of user password
- Protection from online attacks
- Protection from offline attacks
- Instant invalidation of stolen database
- User data encryption with a personal key


## Register Your Account
Before starting practicing with the SDK and usage examples make sure that:
- you have a registered at [Virgil Dashboard](https://dashboard.virgilsecurity.com/)
- you created an application for the Passw0rd use case
- and you got your passw0rd application's credentials such as: `App Secret Key`, `Service Public Key`, `App Token`


## Install and Configure SDK
The passw0rd PHP SDK is provided as a package named `passw0rd/sdk-php`. The package is distributed via Composer. The package is available for PHP 7.0 or newer.


### Install SDK Package

#### Add the vsce_phe_php extension before using this SDK:

* [Download virgil-crypto-c-{latest version} archive from the CDN](https://cdn.virgilsecurity.com/virgil-crypto-c/php/) according to your server operating system
* Place the *vsce_phe_php.so* file from the archive (/lib folder) into the directory with extensions
* Add the *extension=vsce_phe_php* string in to the php.ini file
* Restart your web-service (apache or nginx): *sudo service {apache2 / nginx} restart*

##### Tips:

* PHP version: *phpversion() / php --version*
* OS Version: *PHP_OS*
* php.ini and extensions directory: *phpinfo() / php -i / php-config --extension_dir*

Also, you can launch the *extension/helper.php* file to get information about a version and extensions. 

Now, install passw0rd SDK library with the following code:
```bash
composer require passw0rd/sdk-php
```


### Configure SDK

SDK configuration .env file:

```dotenv
APP_TOKEN=
SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY= 
APP_SECRET_KEY=
UPDATE_TOKEN= //must be empty
```

Here is an example of how to specify your credentials SDK class instance:

```php
use Dotenv\Dotenv;
use passw0rd\Protocol\Protocol;
use passw0rd\Protocol\ProtocolContext;

// Add correct path to .env file!
(new Dotenv("{PATH_TO_FILE}"))->load();

$context = (new ProtocolContext)->create([
    'appToken' => $_ENV['APP_TOKEN'],
    'appSecretKey' => $_ENV['APP_SECRET_KEY'],
    'servicePublicKey' => $_ENV['SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY'],
    'updateToken' => $_ENV['UPDATE_TOKEN']
]);

try {
    $protocol = new Protocol($context);
}
catch(\Exception $e) {
    var_dump($e->getMessage());
}
```

## Prepare Your Database
Passw0rd SDK allows you to easily perform all the necessary operations to create, verify and rotate (update) user's `record`.

**Passw0rd record** - a user's password that is protected with our Passw0rd technology. Passw0rd `record` contains a version, client & server random salts and two values obtained during execution of the PHE protocol.

In order to create and work with user's `record` you have to set up your database with an additional column.

The column must have the following parameters:
<table class="params">
<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Parameters</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Size (bytes)</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>passw0rd_record</td>
	<td>bytearray</td>
	<td>210</td>
	<td> A unique record, namely a user's protected passw0rd.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


## Usage Examples

### Enroll User Record

Use this flow to create a new passw0rd's `record` in your DB for a user.

> Remember, if you already have a database with user passwords, you don't have to wait until a user logs in into your system to implement Passw0rd technology. You can go through your database and enroll (create) a user's `record` at any time.

So, in order to create a `record` for a new database or available one, go through the following operations:
- Take a user's **password** (or its hash or whatever you use) and pass it into the `EnrollAccount` function in a SDK on your Server side.
- Passw0rd SDK will send a request to Passw0rd Service to get enrollment.
- Then, Passw0rd SDK will create a user's `record`. You need to store this unique user's `record` in your database in associated column.

```php
try {
    $enroll = $protocol->enrollAccount($password)); // [record, encryption key]
    $record = $enroll[0]; //save record to database
    $encryptionKey = $enroll[1]; //use encryption key for protecting user data
}
catch(\Exception $e) {
    var_dump($e->getMessage());
    die;
}
```

When you've created a passw0rd's `record` for all users in your DB, you can delete the unnecessary column where user passwords were previously stored.


### Verify User Record

Use this flow when a user already has his or her own passw0rd's `record` in your database. This function allows you to verify user's password with the `record` from your DB every time when the user signs in. You have to pass his or her `record` from your DB into the `VerifyPassword` function:

```php
try {
    $encryptionKey = $protocol->verifyPassword($password, $record)); //use encryption key for decrypting user data
}
catch(\Exception $e) {
    // Login error (incorrect password)
}
if($encryptionKey)
    // Login success
```

## Encrypt user data in your database

Not only user's password is a sensitive data. In this flow we will help you to protect any Personally identifiable information (PII) in your database.

PII is a data that could potentially identify a specific individual, and PII can be sensitive.
Sensitive PII is information which, when disclosed, could result in harm to the individual whose privacy has been breached. Sensitive PII should therefore be encrypted in transit and when data is at rest. Such information includes biometric information, medical information, personally identifiable financial information (PIFI) and unique identifiers such as passport or Social Security numbers.

Passw0rd service allows you to protect user's PII (personal data) with a user's `encryptionKey` that is obtained from `EnrollAccount` or `VerifyPassword` functions. The `encryptionKey` will be the same for both functions.

In addition, this key is unique to a particular user and won't be changed even after rotating (updating) the user's `record`. The `encryptionKey` will be updated after user changes own password.

Here is an example of data encryption/decryption with an `encryptionKey`:

```php
use passw0rd\Core\PHE;

try {
    //key is obtained from protocol->enrollAccount() or protocol->verifyPassword() calls
    $data = "Personal data";

    $phe = new PHE();
    $cipherText = $phe->encrypt($data, $encryptionKey);
    $decrypted = $phe->decrypt($cipherText, $encryptionKey);

    var_dump($decrypted);
}
catch(\Exception $e) {
    var_dump($e);
    die;
}
```
Encryption is performed using AES256-GCM with key & nonce derived from the user's encryptionKey using HKDF and random 256-bit salt.

Virgil Security has Zero knowledge about a user's `encryptionKey`, because the key is calculated every time when you execute `EnrollAccount` or `VerifyPassword` functions at your server side.

## Rotate app keys and user record
There can never be enough security, so you should rotate your sensitive data regularly (about once a week). Use this flow to get an `UPDATE_TOKEN` for updating user's `RECORD` in your database and to get a new `APP_SECRET_KEY` and `SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY` of a specific application.

Also, use this flow in case your database has been COMPROMISED!

> This action doesn't require to create an additional table or to modify scheme of existing table. When a user needs to change his or her own password, use the EnrollAccount function to replace user's oldRecord in your DB with a newRecord.

There is how it works:

**Step 1.** Get your `UPDATE_TOKEN` using [Virgil Dashboard](https://dashboard.virgilsecurity.com)

Move to your Application panel and press “Show update token” button to get the `update_token`.

**Step 2.** Initialize passw0rd SDK with the `UPDATE_TOKEN`
Move to passw0rd SDK configuration .env file and specify your `UPDATE_TOKEN`:

```dotenv
APP_TOKEN=
SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY= 
APP_SECRET_KEY=
UPDATE_TOKEN= //need to be filled
```

**Step 3.** Start migration. Use the `RecordUpdater::update()` SDK method to create a user's `newRecord` (you don't need to ask your users to create a new password). The `RecordUpdater::update()` method requires the `update_token` and user's `oldRecord` from your DB:

```php
use passw0rd\Protocol\RecordUpdater;

try {
    $recordUpdater = new RecordUpdater($_ENV["UPDATE_TOKEN"]);

    $newRecord = $recordUpdater->update($oldRecord));
    
    // $newRecord is null ONLY if $oldRecord is already updated
    if ($newRecord !== null)
        //save new record to the database
}
catch(\Exception $e) {
    var_dump($e->getMessage());
    die;
}
```

So, run the `RecordUpdater::update()` method and save user's `newRecord` into your database.

Since the SDK is able to work simultaneously with two versions of user's records (`newRecord` and `oldRecord`), this will not affect the backend or users. This means, if a user logs into your system when you do the migration, the passw0rd SDK will verify his password without any problems because Passw0rd Service can work with both user's records (`newRecord` and `oldRecord`).


**Step 4.** Get a new `APP_SECRET_KEY` and `SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY` of a specific application

Use Virgil CLI `update-keys` command and your `UPDATE_TOKEN` to update the `APP_SECRET_KEY` and `SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY`:

```bash
// FreeBSD / Linux / Mac OS
./virgil passw0rd update-keys <service_public_key> <app_secret_key> <update_token>

// Windows OS
virgil passw0rd update-keys <service_public_key> <app_secret_key> <update_token>
```

**Step 5.** Move to passw0rd SDK configuration .env file and replace your previous `APP_SECRET_KEY`,  
`SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY` 
with a new one (`APP_TOKEN` will be the same). Delete previous `APP_SECRET_KEY`, `SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `UPDATE_TOKEN`.

```dotenv
APP_TOKEN=
SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY= 
APP_SECRET_KEY=
UPDATE_TOKEN= //must be empty
```
